    About Tyler Siegmund
    </h1>
    <p>
      My name is Tyler Siegmund. I am interested in the concept of Python. <br>
      I play too many video games to count and probably know too much about them. <br>
      I'm not a very social person, but I do talk if needed.<br>
      My dream is to make a game of my own. A little retro RPG game.<br>
      The concept for this game is pretty weird, as it's more on little nods about me. A lot of easter egg ideas. <br>
      I plan to do most of this with one other person. I know it'll be a hard project, but I think i'll manage. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      For my specialties, I'm pretty good at Python. It's something I've spent a lot of time on.<br>
      Another thing I consider a specialty of mine is my writing skills. A lot of free time is spent writing little stories.
